Use ping to generate a data file with 5000 records.  
Use awk, with output redirection to extract the relevant numeric time value (7th column).  
Use awk to calculate the mean and stdev of the time stamps.  
Delete any extra files you may create to store the ping data (you should leave no trace on my computer).  
Submit one txt file as rollnum_ping.txt.
