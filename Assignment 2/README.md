The objectives of this assignment are  
  
Understand how series truncation causes errors  
Learn to use the math library (include math.h and link the library during compilation)  
Understand the use of data types (int, float, double) and correctly convert between them using ceil() or floor()  
  
Write and call a function to calculate the factorial of an integer  
Upload a c-program that will take two arguments as input, int for the number to terms in the truncated series for sin(x) and float for the value of x  
Your program should output only two %.3f values (separated by a comma)    
The estimated value of sin(x) using the truncated series  
The error between the estimated value and the true value (from the math library function sin())
