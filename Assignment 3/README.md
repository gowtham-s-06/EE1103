Generate a set of random numbers from a normal distribution  
Take as argv inputs N mean stdev (assume N < 10001)  
Use the rand function to generate N uniform random values between -1 and 1  
Use the Box-Muller transformation to generate a normal distribution with the given mean and stdev  
Confirm the number of values that like within 1, 2 and 3 standard deviations of the mean.  
Input: 3 values: N mean stdev  
Output: 3 values, separated by commas
